    ```

2. Navigate to the newly created snake-game folder:

    ```bash

    ```

3. In the terminal or command prompt, install the required dependencies by running either of these commands based on your operating system:

Once all dependencies are installed, you're ready to play the game! In the same terminal or command prompt window, run one of these commands depending on your OS:
